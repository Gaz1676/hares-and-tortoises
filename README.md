# Programming-java-project.2

_This was a group project in which we were given a boardgame called "The Hare and the Tortoise" by Gibson._ 

_From playing the game our group had to create a text based representation of the board game._ 

_The IDE's used in the development of this app were Intellij and Eclipse._
***
## Hare and Tortoise Board Game

     * 2 – 6 players

     * 15 hare cards

     * 18 lettuce cards

     * Lots of carrot cards
***
## This is a race game

- _You move by spending carrots (wisely)_

- _You can move as far as you like, once you have the carrots to pay for it. The more you move, the more you pay_

- _You start the game with 65 carrots_

- _You can earn more carrots by landing on certain squares_
***
## Starting the game

- _Each player is given 65 carrots_

- _Each player takes three lettuce cards_

- _Each player can reference the race card to show the possible moves they can take_
***
## Object of the game

- _To get your runner home first_

# BUT

• _You must:_

    * Get rid of all your lettuces on the way round 
    
          >> (this is done by landing on the lettuce squares)
  
    * Not have too many carrots left over when you reach home 
    
          >> (1st home allowed up to 10 unused carrots,2nd 20, 3rd 30, and so on...)
