/**
 * When you land on a Hare square, draw one Hare card from the deck.
 * Do what it says, then place it at the bottom of the deck.
 *
 * The deck contains 1 "shuffle the deck" card, and 2 cards of each other type, for 15 in total.
 *
 * List of all Hare cards:
 * - If there are more players behind you than in front of you, miss a turn. If not, play again.
 * - If equal, of course play again.
 *
 * - Restore your carrot holding to exactly 65.
 * - If you have more than 65, pay extras to the carrot patch; if fewer, draw extras from the carrot patch.
 *
 * - Free Ride!
 * - Your last turn costs nothing; retrieve the carrots you paid to reach this square.
 *
 * - Draw 10 carrots for each lettuce you still hold.
 * - If you have none left, miss a turn.
 *
 * - Show us your carrots!
 * - Count your carrot cards face up to the table so that everyone will know how many you have left.
 *
 * - Give 10 carrots to each player lying behind you in the race (if any).
 * - If you haven't enough carrots, give them five each; if still not possible, one each. A player who doesn't want extra carrots may discard them to the 'carrot patch'.
 *
 * - Lose half your carrots!
 * - If an odd number, keep the odd one.
 *
 * - Shuffle the hare cards and receive from each player 1 carrot for doing so.
 * - Do not replace this card at the bottom of the pack but include it in the shuffle.
