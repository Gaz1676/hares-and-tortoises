 * You may only land on a Lettuce square if you hold at least one Lettuce card. When you do so, turn your token upside-
 * down.
 * At the start of your next turn, discard 1 Lettuce card and gain carrots equal to 10x your position in the race
 * (e.g. 5th place gets 50 carrots). Then turn your token right side up and end your turn.
 * On the turn after that, you return to moving as normal.
