 * When you start your turn on a Number square, and your position matches one of the numbers on it, gain carrots equal

 * you're in when you start your turn, not the position you were in when you landed on the Number square.
 *
 * Types of number square:
 * - 1, 5, 6 (same square counts as all three)
 * - 2
 * - 3
 * - 4
